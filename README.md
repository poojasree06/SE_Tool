**Description:** 

This tool is developed to find carbon footprint of python codes. This tool helps developers and organizations to take steps in reducing their carbon emissions and make their software development activities more sustainable. This is a web based tool where user can drop their python file for which they want to analyze carbon emmisions.
Once the user inputs the python file the tool measures and displays the necessary details(CPU,RAM,Energy,Carbon Emissions) of each function as well as entire file  with visualizations like graphs.

  
**Features:**
* Calculates energy and carbon footprinting for python code
    - Energy consumption by CPU in KWh
    - Energy consumption by RAM in KWh
    - Total power consumption in KW
    - Carbon Footprint in Kg
* Calculates these four metrics of entire python file
* Also calculates for each and every function present in the python file
* Values of these metrics for a file and every function can be viewed in a table
* Energy and carbon footprint values can be compared between the functions using graphs


**Technologies:**  
* Editor: vscode
* Language: python
* WebApp: Flask

 
**Instructions To Run:**  
1) Clone repo   
2) Run "setup.py" file to install necessary dependencies.  
3) Change directory to "webapp"  
4) Command to start the tool - python app.py
